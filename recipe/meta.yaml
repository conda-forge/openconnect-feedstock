  summary: 'OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client'
  description: |
    OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN.
    It has since been ported to support the Juniper SSL VPN (which is now known as
    Pulse Connect Secure), and the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect SSL VPN.

    An openconnect VPN server (ocserv), which implements an improved version of the Cisco AnyConnect
    protocol, has also been written.
